                  + "Skew orthogonal polynomials are a special class of polynomials that arise in the study of random matrices and integrable systems. They are related to, but distinct from, the more familiar orthogonal polynomials. Here's a detailed definition and explanation:\n"
                  + "\n" + "### Basic Definition\n"
                  + "A sequence of polynomials \\(\\{P_n(x)\\}\\) is said to be skew orthogonal if they satisfy a skew-symmetric bilinear form. This means that for two polynomials \\(P_m(x)\\) and \\(P_n(x)\\) in this sequence, the following condition holds:\n"
                  + "\\[\n"
                  + "\\langle P_m, P_n \\rangle = \\int \\int W(x,y) P_m(x) P_n(y) dx dy = \\epsilon_{mn},\n"
                  + "\\]\n"
                  + "where \\(W(x,y)\\) is a skew-symmetric weight function (i.e., \\(W(x,y) = -W(y,x)\\)) and \\(\\epsilon_{mn}\\) is a skew-symmetric matrix, often chosen so that \\(\\epsilon_{mn} = 0\\) for \\(m + n\\) odd and \\(\\epsilon_{mn}\\) is non-zero for \\(m + n\\) even.\n"
                  + "\n" + "### Properties\n"
                  + "- **Degree**: The polynomial \\(P_n(x)\\) is typically of degree \\(n\\).\n"
                  + "- **Normalization**: The polynomials can be normalized in various ways, depending on the application.\n"
                  + "- **Recurrence Relations**: Unlike orthogonal polynomials, skew orthogonal polynomials do not generally satisfy a simple three-term recurrence relation.\n"
                  + "\n" + "### Examples and Applications\n"
                  + "- Skew orthogonal polynomials play a crucial role in the study of random matrix theory, particularly in the analysis of eigenvalue statistics for matrices from the Gaussian symplectic and orthogonal ensembles.\n"
                  + "- They are also important in the study of integrable systems and have applications in mathematical physics.\n"
                  + "\n" + "### Construction\n"
                  + "Constructing skew orthogonal polynomials can be complex. They are often constructed using specific weight functions relevant to the problem at hand. The construction can involve techniques like Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization in the context of a skew-symmetric bilinear form.\n"
                  + "\n" + "### Relation to Orthogonal Polynomials\n"
                  + "While orthogonal polynomials satisfy a symmetry condition with respect to a weight function (i.e., they are orthogonal under a symmetric bilinear form), skew orthogonal polynomials satisfy a skew-symmetry condition. This difference leads to distinct properties and applications.\n"
                  + "\n"
                  + "In summary, skew orthogonal polynomials are a specialized set of polynomials defined by their skew-symmetry under a specific bilinear form, with significant applications in mathematical physics and random matrix theory. Their construction and properties differ notably from the standard orthogonal polynomials.\n"
                  + "\n" + "## Limitations of Regular Orthogonal Polynomials in Random Matrix Ensembles\n" + "\n"
                  + "The limitations of regular orthogonal polynomials in describing certain random matrix ensembles stem from the specific statistical properties and symmetries of these ensembles. Here's an explanation of why regular orthogonal polynomials are not always sufficient:\n"
                  + "\n" + "### Symmetry Classes in Random Matrix Theory\n"
                  + "Random matrix theory classifies matrices into different symmetry classes, such as the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), and Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE). Each of these ensembles has distinct symmetry properties:\n"
                  + "- GOE represents real symmetric matrices and is invariant under orthogonal transformations.\n"
                  + "- GUE represents complex Hermitian matrices and is invariant under unitary transformations.\n"
                  + "- GSE represents quaternionic self-dual matrices and is invariant under symplectic transformations.\n"
                  + "\n" + "### Eigenvalue Correlations\n"
                  + "The study of random matrices often focuses on the statistical properties of their eigenvalues, particularly the correlations between them. These correlations differ depending on the symmetry class of the matrix ensemble.\n"
                  + "\n" + "### Role of Orthogonal Polynomials\n"
                  + "For ensembles like the GUE, standard orthogonal polynomials (such as Hermite polynomials) are effective in describing the eigenvalue statistics. This is because the joint probability distribution of eigenvalues in these ensembles leads to a determinantal point process, which can be analyzed using orthogonal polynomials.\n"
                  + "\n" + "### Limitation for Other Ensembles\n"
                  + "For ensembles like the GOE and GSE, the situation is more complex. The joint probability distributions of these ensembles lead to Pfaffian point processes, not determinantal. In these cases, the correlation functions involve not just the values of a polynomial at different points, but also their derivatives. This necessitates the use of skew orthogonal polynomials, which are designed to handle the skew-symmetric structure inherent in these ensembles.\n"
                  + "\n" + "### Skew Symmetry\n"
                  + "Skew orthogonal polynomials are tailored to handle the skew-symmetric nature of the correlation functions in ensembles like GOE and GSE. Regular orthogonal polynomials do not possess the necessary properties to adequately describe these skew-symmetric relationships.\n"
                  + "\n"
                  + "In summary, while regular orthogonal polynomials are well-suited for analyzing certain random matrix ensembles (\n"
